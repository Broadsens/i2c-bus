- test with two buses
- can the callback for writeBytes get three arguments for consistency with
  other similar callbacks (err, bytesWritten, buffer)?
- should writeBytesSync return the the number of bytes read rather than this?
- rename readBytes to i2cReadBytes, or readI2cBytes, or readI2cBlock?
- rename readBytesSync to i2cReadBytesSync, or ...?
- rename writeBytes to i2cWriteBytes, or ...?
- rename writeBytesSync to i2cWriteBytesSync, or ...?
- implement smbus quick command
- implement smbus block read (do the renaming mentioned above first)
- implement smbus block write (do the renaming mentioned above first)
- implement smbus process call
- implement smbus block process call
- rename smbusReadbyte to smbusReadByte
