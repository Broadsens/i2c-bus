  - chack arg count and arg types in addon methods
- in addon methods, return integer instead of number where possible?
- close and closeSync also needed
- jslint everything

- there's lots of this: int fd = args[0]->Uint32Value(); int and unsigned int together!
- return this in all js methods where it makes sense
- block operations
- test with two buses
- test with more than one device on a single bus
- performance tests
