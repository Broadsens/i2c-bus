- test with two buses
- can the callback for writeBytes get three arguments for consistency with
  other similar callbacks (err, bytesWritten, buffer)?
- should writeBytesSync return the the number of bytes read rather than this?
- implement smbus quick command
- implement smbus block read (do the renaming mentioned above first)
- implement smbus block write (do the renaming mentioned above first)
- implement smbus process call
- implement smbus block process call
